# RollDice Flutter App

Welcome to my first Flutter app, RollDice! This simple yet fun app allows you to roll a virtual dice by simply clicking a button. With each click, the dice will roll and display a random number between 1 and 6, just like a real six-sided die.

## How to Use
1. Install the Flutter framework on your device if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device using `flutter run` command.

## Features
- Single button interface for rolling the dice.
- Realistic dice rolling animation.
- Random number generation between 1 and 6.

Feel free to explore the code and customize the app as you like. This project serves as a great starting point for learning Flutter and mobile app development. Have fun rolling the dice!
